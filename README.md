# Stardew Valley Backup Scripts
Dumb PowerShell scripts to help with backing up Stardew Valley saves, mostly so Steam doesn't accidentally overwrite you when swapping between computers/users.

As the above suggests, you need to have PowerShell for this to work. It's been tested on an up-to-date-as-of-this-writing version of Windows 10 and 11 with no issue.

In theory, it should find your Stardew Valley saves, then copy them to C:\Users\Public\Documents\StardewValleySaveBackups (or wherever your Public\Documents lives) in dated folders sorted by Windows user.

It does _not_ sort by Steam user yet, I may make that work in a later enhancement.

As is always true, you should review any scripts from the internet before running them, including these ones.

To use...
1. Download the latest version here: [Link](https://codeload.github.com/epyonavenger/stardew_save_backups/zip/refs/heads/main)
2. Unzip using your favorite unzip tool.
3. Navigate into "stardew_save_backups-main" you unzipped and double-click "run_me.bat"
4. Follow the prompts.
5. Rejoice! (Hopefully)
